# Deploy 🚀

The Deployment section guides you through deploying services across major cloud providers ☁️. It provides comprehensive deployment guides tailored for each platform, ensuring a smooth experience.

Here, you'll find instructions for deploying Care, Ayushma, and related components on AWS, GCP, and Azure. These guides cover setting up accounts, configuring services, provisioning Kubernetes clusters 🐳, managing databases and storage, and deploying workloads.

Additionally, this section explores Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform 🤖, enabling automated and consistent deployments.

We recommend referring to the [Coronasafe Deploydocs](https://deploydocs.coronasafe.network/) 📚, a valuable resource with in-depth documentation for deploying Care across multiple clouds.
