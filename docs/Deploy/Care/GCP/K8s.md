Script provisions a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, sets up the Kubernetes configuration, and deploys the Cert Manager using Helm. 

1. **Google Kubernetes Engine Cluster**:
   - **Name**: Defines the name of the GKE cluster as "care-gke".
   - **Location**: Specifies the location of the GKE cluster in the "asia-south1-c" zone.
   - **Network**: Specifies the VPC network named "care-vpc" for the cluster.
   - **Subnetwork**: Specifies the subnet for the cluster.
   - **Initial Node Count**: Sets the initial number of nodes to 2.
   - **Deletion Protection**: Disables deletion protection for the cluster.
   - **Private Cluster Configuration**: Disables private nodes and private endpoint for the cluster.
   - **Node Configuration**: Defines the machine type, disk size, disk type, and tags for the cluster nodes.
   - **Lifecycle**: Ignores changes to deletion protection.

2. **Setting Kubernetes Configuration**:
   - A `null_resource` named "set_kubeconfig" is used to execute a local command to set up the Kubernetes configuration.
   - The `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` command is executed to fetch the credentials for the GKE cluster and update the Kubernetes configuration.

3. **Switching Kubernetes Context**:
   - Another `null_resource` named "switch_kube_context" is used to execute a local command to switch the Kubernetes context.
   - The `kubectl config use-context` command is executed to set the current Kubernetes context to the GKE cluster context.
   - The `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set to the path of the Kubernetes configuration file.

4. **Deploying Cert Manager with Helm**:
   - A Helm chart named "cert-manager" is deployed into the "cert-manager" namespace.
   - The Helm repository URL is specified as "https://charts.jetstack.io".
   - The Helm release is configured to create the namespace if it does not exist.
   - Additional settings are applied to install Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for Cert Manager.
   - This deployment depends on the completion of switching the Kubernetes context to ensure that the correct context is used for Helm installation.

The script automates the setup of a GKE cluster, configures the Kubernetes context, and deploys Cert Manager for managing TLS certificates within the Kubernetes cluster.
