## Setting up Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) infrastructure.

1. **Key Ring Creation**: It creates a key ring with a specific name and location.
2. **Crypto Key Creation**: It creates a cryptographic key within the key ring for encryption and decryption, with a specified rotation period and purpose.
3. **Crypto Key Version**: It creates a version of the cryptographic key.
4. **IAM Policy Setup**:
   - It fetches an IAM policy granting cloudkms.admin role to a specified user.
   - It applies this policy to both the key ring and the cryptographic key.

In summary, this setup establishes a secure environment for managing cryptographic keys on Google Cloud, with specific permissions granted to a designated user for administrative access.
