1. **IAM Member for KMS Encryption**:
   - Grants a service account the role of `roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter` for the project, enabling it to encrypt and decrypt data using the specified KMS key.

2. **Google Cloud Storage Buckets**:
   - **care-facility**: A bucket for storing facility images.
   - **care-patient-data**: A bucket for storing patient files.
     - Both buckets share similar configurations:
       - Naming Convention: Follows a specific pattern based on the project name and region.
       - Location: Specifies the region for data storage.
       - Storage Class: Utilizes the STANDARD storage class for general-purpose storage.
       - Versioning: Enabled to retain multiple versions of objects.
       - Encryption: Configured to utilize the KMS key specified in a remote Terraform state for data encryption.
       - Dependency: Relies on the IAM member resource to ensure proper sequencing during deployment.
       - Public Access Restriction: Enforced to prevent unauthorized public access to the buckets.
       - Labels: Optional labels for organizing and categorizing resources.
       - Uniform Bucket Level Access: Activated to regulate access to buckets and objects using IAM policies.

3. **IAM Policy Management for Buckets**:
   - Assigns the role of `roles/storage.admin` to a designated user (`example@mail.com`) for each bucket, granting administrative privileges to manage the buckets and their contents.

4. **Configure CORS**:
   - Activates Cloud Shell for executing commands.
   - Provides a sample `bucket-config.json` file containing CORS configuration settings.
   - Instructs users to replace the placeholder origins with their actual deployed frontend URLs.
   - Guides users to apply the CORS configuration for both buckets using the `gcloud` CLI.

Here's the CORS configuration code for `bucket-config.json`:

```json
[
   {
     "origin": ["https://care.ohc.network", "https://care.coronasafe.in"],
     "method": ["GET", "PUT"],
     "responseHeader": ["*"],
     "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
   }
]
```

Following this configuration, users can execute the following commands in Cloud Shell to apply the CORS configuration to each bucket:

```bash
gcloud storage buckets update gs://<prefix>-care-facility --cors-file=bucket-config.json
gcloud storage buckets update gs://<prefix>-care-patient-data --cors-file=bucket-config.json
```

Setup ensures the creation of secure storage buckets with proper encryption, access controls, and CORS configuration in Google Cloud Storage.
