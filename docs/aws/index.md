| S3 Buckets         | Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides object storage that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. S3 buckets are highly scalable, durable, and secure, making them suitable for a wide range of use cases such as storing Care-patient Data, Facility data, terraform state, and CloudFront CDN data. Buckets can be configured as public or private, with access policies controlling access.                | Example Usage can be found [here](./S3)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| EKS                | Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS. It eliminates the need to install and operate Kubernetes clusters manually, allowing users to focus on building and running applications. EKS integrates with other AWS services and offers native Kubernetes tooling for seamless management.            | The [coronasafe deploy docs](https://deploydocs.coronasafe.network/cloud-deployment-overview/aws) explain how Care is set up using AWS EKS and other AWS resources.                                                                                               |
| CloudFormation     | AWS CloudFormation is a service that enables users to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative manner using templates. It automates the provisioning and management of AWS resources, making it easier to create and manage complex infrastructure deployments. CloudFormation stacks are used to manage ECS resources for Care-Development instances, providing a consistent and repeatable deployment process. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| RDS                | Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed database service that simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of relational databases in the cloud. It supports popular database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, automating administrative tasks such as provisioning, backups, and patching. Care-Development deployment utilizes a single RDS instance for managing relational database workloads efficiently.       | |
